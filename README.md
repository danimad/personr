## personr

My personel R package containing useful R functions.  
Very experimental, and badly documented.  
Made with the help from the tutorials of [Hilary Parker](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) 
and [Karl Broman](http://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/).
My snippets can be found [here](https://github.com/danimad/r_snippets)
